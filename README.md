# IEEE-VR-2021-Poster
Hand-by-Hand Mentor: An AR-based Training System for Piano Performance", expected to be accepted by the IEEE Virtual Reality Conference (IEEE VR2021) as a poster on February 22, 2021.



#### Abstractï¼š

Multimedia instrument training has gained great momentum benefiting from augmented and/or virtual reality (AR/VR) technologies. We present an AR-based individual training system for piano performance that uses only MIDI data as input. Based on fingerings decided by a pre-trained Hidden Markov Model (HMM), the system employs musical prior knowledge to generate natural-looking 3D animation of hand motion automatically. The generated virtual hand demonstrations are rendered in head-mounted displays and registered with a piano roll. Two user studies conducted by us show that the system requires relatively less cognitive load and may increase learning efficiency and quality.
